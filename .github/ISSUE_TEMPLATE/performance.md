## Performance Issue

A clear description of the performance problem.

## Current Performance

Describe the current performance characteristics:

- Measured metrics [e.g., execution time, memory usage, response time]
- Benchmark results if available
- Performance degradation patterns

## Expected Performance

What performance level would you expect or require?

## Environment

- Operating System: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13.0, Windows 11]
- Hardware: [CPU, RAM, storage type]
- Version: [e.g., 1.0.0]
- Scale: [data volume, concurrent users, load characteristics]
- Configuration: [relevant performance settings]

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Measure performance
4. Observe the issue

## Measurements

Provide specific performance measurements:

```
// Benchmark results, profiling data, or metrics
```

## Impact

- How does this affect your use case?
- What is the severity? [e.g., critical, major, minor]
- Is there a workaround?
- What is the performance target or requirement?

## Profiling Information

If available, provide:

- Profiling reports
- Flame graphs
- Memory snapshots
- CPU usage patterns
- Network traces

## Potential Optimization

If you have suggestions for improving performance, describe them here:

- Identified bottlenecks
- Proposed optimization approaches
- Trade-offs to consider

## Additional Context
